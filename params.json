{"name":"Local system directory mapping ","tagline":"A webApp built in Django for mapping local system directories to authenticated user","body":"### Introduction\r\n\r\nThis App can be used as it is by adding the required .html in /templates directory. Currently it will authenticate users and authorize access to local system directories. So, for example if you are to serve/distribute thousands of logs to users, simply filter the data and redirect the users to specific directory without hassles of maintaining a Database for randomly generated data like logs. Simply map the user to a directory.\r\n\r\nThe file at /Local-system-directory-serve/app/lib/EditRsyslog.py filters the incoming logs and creates directories based on the IP address. The files in the 'App' directory uses the configuration file generated to serve user files based on the user and directory after authentication.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nNaga Sreekanth (@nagsrk)\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nFor any support contact nagsrk@venelio.com and Iâ€™ll help you sort it out.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
