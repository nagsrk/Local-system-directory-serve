Currently it will authenticate users and authorize access to local system directories. So, for example if you are to serve/distribute thousands of logs to users, simply filter the data and redirect the users to specific directory without hassles of maintaining a Database for randomly generated data like logs. Simply map the user to a directory.\r\n\r\nThe file at /Local-system-directory-serve/app/lib/EditRsyslog.py filters the incoming logs and creates directories based on the IP address. The files in the 'App' directory uses the configuration file generated to serve user files based on the user and directory after authentication.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nNaga Sreekanth (@nagsrk)\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nFor any support contact nagsrk@venelio.com and I’ll help you sort it out.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
